This is my boilerplate for making web applications.

## Getting Started

Install packages with `pnpm i`.

Generate prisma files:
```bash
pnpm generate
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

For making prisma migrations, use
```bash
pnpm prisma:migrate
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
